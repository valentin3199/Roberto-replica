It has always been at my core who I really am, I want to build the world that I'm going to live in, I can't just accept something as it is without wanting to see if I can somehow improve on it, or even make something completely different. As a kid I would spend hours drawing or taking things apart and putting them back together. It is no real surprise that I can balance creativity and technical ability, or why I am so passionate about both of these things.</p><p>Telling stories is also something I've always done, even in the early days. I remember drawing my own comic books by hand, stapling them together and selling them to my classmates at 6 years old. Even then I was a creative entrepreneur. 10 years old was when I became fascinated by cameras and photography, and capturing the world one snapshot at a time. By the time I was 13 years old, we'd gotten our first real computer and that summer I taught myself HTML code so I could create websites instead of just consume them. Fast forward to me at 15 years old where I started learning to create and edit videos... a whole 5 years before YouTube would be invented. Investing in the skills that would be the foundation of my career is something I did wait till 18 years old to do.</p><p>Communication, storytelling, that is my core skill. I've never been a "Jack of All Trades, Master of None"; no more than an well toned athlete who does a triathlon. I've applied the <strong>skill of storytelling</strong> as my interest and current technology evolved. I consider myself to be an explorer, a mapmaker on a journey of the creative landscape and I constantly want to challenge myself and find a new way of starting a conversation.</p><p>That is why my career has been so interesting and has taken so many directions. It represents my true narrative as an explorer and wanderer. As a creative entrepreneur, you find a balance of creativity and consistency that is very hard to come by otherwise. The challenge of building something and growing it is something that can be very appealing, and for me it is ideal. I found what I want my life and legacy to be:</p><p><em>"Create Awesome Things and Share Them With the World, While Educating and Motivating Others to Do the Same." </em></p><p>Everyday I get to explore the things I'm most passionate about and serve clients and creatives that I believe in creating value for. The opportunity to build things, and invest in the personal growth of other human beings and enable entrepreneurship is a life and career I am very grateful for. Each day I get to educate, empower, encourage and enable others to be successful and awesome human being that create value through their work, their passion or their businesses.</p></div></div><hr></div></div><hr><div class="featured"><h3>Featured On</h3><div class="featured__image"></div></div><div class="footer"><div class="footer"><div class="footer__social"><h2>Let's Connect</h2><p>Feel free to reach out to me!</p><p> <a href="tel:+1-310-409-5408">P: 310.409.5408</a></p><p><img src="/asset/image/roberto-blake-email.png" alt="Let's have a quick chat" width="218" height="28"></p><ul><li class="social__item"><a class="social__icon" href="http://twitter.com/robertoblake" title="twitter"></a><p class="footer__description">Reach me directly and ask me your questions. #AskRoberto</p></li><li class="social__item"><a class="social__icon" href="http://youtube.com/robertoblake2" title="youtube"></a><p class="footer__description">Watch my videos and learn to Create Something Awesome.</p></li><li class="social__item"><a class="social__icon" href="http://myawesomescope.com" title="periscope"></a><p class="footer__description">Watch Me LIVE and engage in the comment section.</p></li><li class="social__item"><a class="social__icon" href="http://facebook.com/robertoblake2" title="facebook"></a><p class="footer__description">Find out when I'm doing speaking events and what I'm working on.</p></li></ul></div><p>Copyright &copy; 2019 &middot; All Rights Reserved</p><p><a class="footer__link" href="/">Roberto Blake</a></p></div></div><script src="/asset/js/all.js"></script></body></html><link rel="stylesheet" href="/style.css">
